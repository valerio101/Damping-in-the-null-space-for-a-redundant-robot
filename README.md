In this project, we studied and simulated the behavior of the **Kuka LWR4** in tracking a circular trajectory using different types of damping. Specifically, three cases were considered: **no damping**, **velocity damping**, and **momentum damping**.

+ **simulation_robot2**: This folder contains the **example** file, which includes the code to configure the robot and the initial trajectory. It generates and displays joint velocity, torque, position, and trajectory tracking graphs. Additionally, the **model1** file contains the robot's Simulink model and the torque control used in the system.

+ **simulation_robot2acc**: This folder contains the **example** file, which provides the code to configure the robot and the initial trajectory. It generates joint velocity, acceleration, position, and trajectory tracking graphs. The **model1acc** file contains the robot's Simulink model and the acceleration control used.

+ **HW_Robotics_II:** This document summarizes the basic theory needed to understand the project, with a final section describing the various simulations performed to analyze the robot's behavior.

+ **Videos:** This folder contains several videos related to different simulations, with varying gain parameters, the addition of constraints on acceleration or torque, and simulations with different trajectories.
